# Credit Risk Modeling

Welcome to the Credit Risk Modeling repository! This repo showcases how I have utilized my Risk Management learning and combined it with my passion for data science by building a credit risk modeling. I have developed this class by class for easy understanding, catering to learners from beginner to expert levels. This repository offers a unique opportunity for me to develop a valuable skill set in a niche yet highly sought-after area.

## About the Course

Credit risk modeling sits at the intersection of data science and fintech, making it an ideal training ground for those seeking to differentiate themselves in the industry like me. This report provides a comprehensive look at how credit risk models are built and applied in real-world scenarios.

## What You'll Find

- **Data Pre-processing**: Essential initial steps like weight of evidence, information value, fine classing, and coarse classing. These techniques are vital for preparing data for modeling.

- **Modeling Techniques**: Application of logistic and linear regression to estimate the three components of the fundamental credit risk equation: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD).

- **Model Evaluation Tools**: Introduction to advanced tools for evaluating the predictive power of your model, including Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Gini Coefficient.

- **Model Monitoring and Maintenance**: Learning how to monitor your model's performance through the Population Stability Index and maintain it as needed.
